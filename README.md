# Weather Dashboard

A 5 day weather forecast for multiple cities.

## Description

The project represents an application that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing.

The application has the following functionalities:

- The user can input a city of their preference in the search field
- Once they tap on the "Search" button, the application stores the searched city in the local storage and renders this information in the form of a button on the page
- For each searched city, the application offers information on the current weather and a 5-day forecast, retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API
- The user can tap on the grey buttons to access the weather on previously searched city
